      "text_narrative": "On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of thegarret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation,towards K. bridge.He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garretwas under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboardthan a room. The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, andattendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obligedto pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open. And each time hepassed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl andfeel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid ofmeeting her.This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but forsome time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging onhypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolatedfrom his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone atall. He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of lateceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practicalimportance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could dohad a real terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen toher trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats andcomplaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie\u2014no, ratherthan that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutelyaware of his fears.thought, with an odd smile. slip from cowardice, that\u2019s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it ismen are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fearmost.... But I am talking too much. It\u2019s because I chatter that I do nothing. Orperhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I\u2019ve learned to chatter this lastmonth, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the Giant-killer.Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that serious? It is notserious at all. It\u2019s simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it isa plaything.\u201d",

Theinsufferable stench from the pot-houses, which are particularly numerous in thatpart of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it wasa working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression ofthe profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man\u2019s refined face.He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deepthought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; hewalked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it.From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking tohimself, to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would becomeconscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak;for two days he had scarcely tasted food.He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness wouldhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter of thetown, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise.Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of establishments of badcharacter, the preponderance of the trading and working class populationcrowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so variouswere to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have causedsurprise. But there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the youngman\u2019s heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his ragsleast of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintancesor with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time.And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being takensomewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly shoutedvoice and pointing at him\u2014the young man stopped suddenly and clutchedtremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat from Zimmerman\u2019s, but completelyworn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side",

But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, andopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which waspartitioned off from the tiny kitchen.
